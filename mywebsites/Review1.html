 Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids(14+ 11) stayed 3 nights. Hotel is convenient and also for easy access to place.The location, with the adjacent canal, is a real bonus and nice for walking beside with rivers,snow. We ate dinner locally twice at MAD Hotel(left from hotel and 100 metre walk) which was excellent: good traditional cooking with a great atmosphere and we highly recommend.</li> </br> </br>
